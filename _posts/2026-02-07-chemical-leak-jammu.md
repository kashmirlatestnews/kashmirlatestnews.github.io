One Terrorist Neutralised in Ongoing Operation in Kishtwar District
Security forces neutralised one suspected terrorist during an ongoing joint operation in the higher reaches of Kishtwar district in Jammu and Kashmir. The contact occurred in the Dichhar area around late afternoon, as part of continued efforts to locate militants in the region.
The operation, involving troops from the Army, Jammu and Kashmir Police, and Central Reserve Police Force, re-established engagement with individuals believed to be on the run following earlier contacts in the same belt. Officials reported that the individual was eliminated in the exchange of fire, and search activities remain active in the challenging, snow-affected terrain.
This incident is linked to a series of recent operations in the Chhatroo and surrounding forest areas, where security teams have been conducting searches based on intelligence inputs about militant presence. No casualties were reported among security personnel in this specific contact.
Surveillance has been stepped up in nearby zones, including parts of Doda district, to prevent any possible movement of individuals across locations. Authorities continue to monitor the situation closely amid difficult weather and geographical conditions.
The operation highlights sustained counter-insurgency measures in the Jammu region's hilly districts to address security concerns.
