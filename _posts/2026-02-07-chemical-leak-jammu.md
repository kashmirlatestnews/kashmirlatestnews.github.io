categories: securityJammu, February 7, 2026 — A chemical leak occurred on Jammu Airport Road on Saturday, triggering a rapid response from disaster management authorities. No casualties have been reported, and the situation has been brought under control.The incident took place near a shop approximately 500 meters from Jammu Airport, where a cylinder reportedly leaked a hazardous substance. Initial reports from local sources and media described the leaked chemical as sulfur mustard (also referred to as mustard sulfur or mustard gas), a highly toxic blistering agent classified as a chemical warfare material.Teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), equipped with protective gear, were deployed to the site along with local police, fire services, and other emergency personnel. Authorities stated that containment measures were successfully implemented, securing the area and preventing further spread of the substance.Official statements emphasized that the situation is now stable, with no immediate risk to the public. An investigation has been initiated to determine the exact nature of the leaked material through scientific analysis, as well as to establish how the cylinder came to be at the location. While some sources suggested a possible defense-related connection for the substance, officials have not confirmed this detail, and the probe remains ongoing.Sulfur mustard is a prohibited chemical agent under international conventions due to its severe effects on skin, eyes, and respiratory system, potentially causing burns, blisters, and long-term health damage.Local residents in the vicinity experienced panic following the leak, but emergency services assured the community that the area is safe following the response operation. Further updates are expected as the investigation progresses.Authorities have urged the public to avoid speculation and rely on official communications regarding the incident.
