Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir are maintaining strong momentum in their counter-terrorism efforts, with **Operation Trashi-I** in Kishtwar district remaining one of the most active and prolonged operations in the region as of February 9, 2026. Launched more than 20 days ago, the joint operation by the Indian Army (White Knight Corps), Jammu and Kashmir Police, and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) continues to focus on eliminating militant hideouts in the challenging, high-altitude forests of the Chatroo belt.

### Current Status of Operation Trashi-I
The operation, centered in the remote and densely forested areas around Dichhar, Sonar, and Janseer-Kandiwar in Kishtwar, has seen multiple engagements over the past weeks. Security teams are conducting **search-and-cordon** (S&C) activities deep inside the jungles, using a combination of ground patrols, drones for aerial surveillance, and sniffer dogs to track any remaining suspects.

As of today, February 9, no new gunfights or direct contacts have been reported, but the operation has not slowed down. Troops from units like the 7 Assam Rifles are pushing forward with intensive searches, navigating difficult terrain made even more treacherous by recent snowfall. Officials indicate that the focus is on maintaining pressure on possible hideouts and preventing militants from regrouping or escaping the cordoned zones.

### Key Recent Developments
The most significant breakthrough in this operation came on **February 4, 2026**, when security forces re-established contact with militants in the general area of Dichhar around 5:45 PM. A brief but intense exchange of fire followed, resulting in the neutralization of one suspected terrorist, believed to be of Pakistani origin and linked to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). Following the engagement, forces recovered a cache of weapons, ammunition, and winter supplies from a militant hideout, indicating that the group had been preparing for extended survival in the harsh winter environment.

This incident marked a clear success in the ongoing hunt, but it also highlighted the persistence of militant activity in the area. The operation has already recorded several such contacts in the past weeks, with forces gradually tightening the net.

### Casualties and Human Cost
The pursuit has come at a price for security personnel. Earlier in the operation (around mid-January), a grenade attack during a gunfight in the Sonar area injured 7–8 soldiers, with splinter wounds reported. One paratrooper succumbed to his injuries on January 19, while two others were in critical condition before being airlifted to a hospital in Udhampur for advanced treatment. No new injuries have been reported in the latest phase, but the risk remains high due to the terrain and militant tactics.

### Broader Security Context in Jammu & Kashmir
Operation Trashi-I is part of a larger wave of counter-terrorism activity across Jammu and Kashmir in recent months. Related developments include:

- **Udhampur district** (early February): A separate operation in the Basantgarh forests led to the elimination of 2–3 militants hiding in a cave. This was part of a quick-response action using paratroopers and tracking dogs.
- **Akhnoor sector** (LoC area, February 6–7): Forces successfully foiled an infiltration attempt, engaging intruders in a gunfight. One Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) lost his life in the exchange, underscoring the continued pressure along the border.
- **Overall trend**: Officials have noted increased militant attempts to regroup or infiltrate during winter, when movement is restricted but hideouts become more viable due to snow cover.

These operations reflect the multi-agency coordination between the Army, police, and paramilitary forces, with emphasis on intelligence-led actions and use of modern technology like drones to minimize risks to troops.

### Challenges in Winter Operations
The current season adds significant difficulties:
- **Weather and terrain** — Heavy snowfall limits visibility, mobility, and supply lines. High-altitude areas become isolated quickly.
- **Militant advantages** — Forests provide natural cover, while caves and natural shelters allow prolonged hiding.
- **Civilian considerations** — Forces have maintained cordons in nearby villages with care to avoid disruption, while ensuring local cooperation and safety.

Despite these obstacles, the sustained effort shows the commitment to clearing militant presence from the region.

### Political and Official Statements
On February 9, Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha directed police forces to take decisive action against terrorism, urging collaboration with all sections of society to dismantle terror networks completely. This comes amid ongoing security reviews, including recent high-level meetings attended by senior Army officials.

The Army Chief has also emphasized the integration of advanced technologies to boost operational effectiveness, following visits and briefings in forward areas.

### Way Forward
As Operation Trashi-I enters its third week, security forces are expected to continue expanding their search radius while maintaining tight control over the area. Any fresh developments — whether new contacts, recoveries, or neutralization — will be closely watched, as they could indicate the strength of remaining militant networks in the district.

This operation, alongside others in Udhampur and along the LoC, demonstrates the persistent challenge of countering terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, even as the region sees overall improvements in stability and civilian life in many areas.
